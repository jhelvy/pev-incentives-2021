"One question I had: is the tax credit option a ""refundable"" credit? Reason I'm asking is that my income is so low that I often don't owe income taxes--so a non-refundable tax credit holds no interest for me. A refundable credit, on the other hand, feels like free money, and would definitely be of interest."

I think gasoline is the best type of vehicle. The electric ones are expensive to maintain and repair.

"Well put together, but..., maybe you could share on the last page a chart of current depositions or talked about est.rebate/deductions etc. Just for informations sake. It would probably help random peoples to get a visual for their future decisions. ""If appliable"""

I enjoyed the survey it was fun
Nothing I can think of
"instructing respondents to select from among a fixed volume of ""rebate"" or ""credit"" options represents amateurish research methodology - many individuals availing themselves of this survey would never consider alternative engergy vehicles, and your results will be skewed accordingly...terrible job  by your marketing department"
Good job.
It was a very interest survey

It would be nice to have drawings to give away some of these vehicles every so often
Wouldn't you like to know what your respondents think about electric vehicles?  They are bad for the environment (batteries can't be recycled and mining for battery materials is destructive). There is a lack of  the infrastructure necessary to recharge them. Recharging them takes too long. They take too much electricity to recharge. They don't work for the long distances that rural drivers have to drive. No one except for rich people will be able to afford them.
Nothing.  The survey was well written and easy to understand
