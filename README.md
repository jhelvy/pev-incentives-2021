# pev-incentives-2021

This repo contains the data and code to reproduce results from the PEV incentive preference experiment we conducted in the fall of 2021. Results were published in this paper:

Roberson, Laura A. & Helveston, John P. (2022) “Not all subsidies are equal: Measuring preferences for electric vehicle financial incentives,” _Environmental Research Letters_. DOI: [10.1088/1748-9326/ac7df3](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac7df3)

To reproduce the result, install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), then open the "pev-incentives-2021.Rproj" file. Be sure to open this first to set the root of the project to this folder.
