At same time, Newsome and the Dems have implemented programs to take power plants off line that are needed to support the grid.  This results in even further lack of power just for homes and businesses.  Add to that millions of electric vehicles that need power, WON'T WORK!!!   Additionally, it takes me 5 minutes to refuel my vehicle using gasoline/diesel fuel.  Takes minimum of 30 minutes to do the same for electrical vehicles - think of the lines waiting their turn to recharge!!!   Lastly, range of gas powered vehicles is further than electric vehicles and IF they could find a place to recharge, their total trip time is expanded significantly ESPECIALLY for cross country trips e.g. California to Washington DC.  California needs to build nuclear power plants to make this scheme work.  Same with other States."
