I wish there had been a chart to compare the calculations of each scenario. I was just picking the ones that I thought would save me the most money (didn’t matter the time frame) but it was hard to know without doing calculations.
It’s good

Great survey. I absolutely love financial matters.

"The sales tax credit is a bit tricky. Since I expect my actual sales tax to be at most $2000, probably a fair bit less, a ""$2600"" credit isn't as great as it sounds. And so I often eschewed that choice  in cases where it would APPEAR to be the best."
Interesting topic
good job!
