"The sales tax credit is a bit tricky. Since I expect my actual sales tax to be at most $2000, probably a fair bit less, a ""$2600"" credit isn't as great as it sounds. And so I often eschewed that choice  in cases where it would APPEAR to be the best."

"Electric vehicles sound great, BUT I live in California where brown outs are common due to insufficient electrical grid to supply enough power.  At same time, Newsome and the Dems have implemented programs to take power plants off line that are needed to support the grid.  This results in even further lack of power just for homes and businesses.  Add to that millions of electric vehicles that need power, WON'T WORK!!!   Additionally, it takes me 5 minutes to refuel my vehicle using gasoline/diesel fuel.  Takes minimum of 30 minutes to do the same for electrical vehicles - think of the lines waiting their turn to recharge!!!   Lastly, range of gas powered vehicles is further than electric vehicles and IF they could find a place to recharge, their total trip time is expanded significantly ESPECIALLY for cross country trips e.g. California to Washington DC.  California needs to build nuclear power plants to make this scheme work.  Same with other States."

"I would like to own a plug-in hybrid vehicle but because of my living arrangements (in a multi-family apartment complex), the means to charge my vehicle is completely unavailable. So, unless I moved to a single-home where charging my car is not an issue, I have to dismiss any notion of buying an electric car. So, please factor in this set of circumstance in your research, i.e. a person loves to buy an electric vehicle but restricted from doing so because  of living space considerations."

I believe we are years away from a viable electric vehicle. Batteries will need replacing at an outrageous cost. Charging will be very expensive. A charge does not last long enough. I drive up to 800 miles per day on vacations and electric vehicles aren't capable of this. They are great for urban use but not practical for most. They aren't worth the price no matter the incentive.
