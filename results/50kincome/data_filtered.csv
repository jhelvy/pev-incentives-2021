They are bad for the environment (batteries can't be recycled and mining for battery materials is destructive). There is a lack of  the infrastructure necessary to recharge them. Recharging them takes too long. They take too much electricity to recharge. They don't work for the long distances that rural drivers have to drive. No one except for rich people will be able to afford them.,424
